# Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a process by which you identify your assets, and their importance/personal value to you as an individual/organization/enterprise and then assess all the ways in which the asset is under risk and try to mitigate them to the best of your abilities.

Assets are things that you care about. An asset could be a piece of paper, or a PDF file. Importance of the asset is how essential a particular asset is over other assets. For example, you might have a few hundred-euro bills in your wallet and the photo of your deceased wife. Both are things you care about, but you'd rather lose the euro bills than lose the photo. So the photo is of higher importance. Both are important. But the photo could be 'more' important than the rest of the stuff in your wallet. 

Risks are the bad things that can happen to your asset. Risks could be unavailability, breach in confidentiality/privacy, breach in integrity, etc. So if you want your PDF file to be always available, you'd make backup copies of it and save it in several places. If confidentiality of the file is important, then you'd encrypt it, and so on.
