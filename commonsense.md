# Common sense, do you have it?

Common sense is a very important ingredient in security. It takes common sense to know that you have NOT won several thousand dollars in lottery or that you have NOT been left with a million pounds by a soon-to-be dead nigerian king! 

And no do not click on the "Omg, you won't believe what happened next" link or the "This girl dares to do what most other girls don't" link. Do not respond to the shady email that claims to be from your bank. Do not reveal your security credentials over phone. Do not reveal your personal details on Facebook. And for heaven's sake, do not ever put up details of kids, cute toddlers, yours or others' on any social networking website like Facebook. 

Do not give away your information to strangers unneccessarily. Just give them enough information to get what you need. Do not let yourself be coerced by the government and the government servants into giving up your information including biometric data. Demand identification documents from police and government personnel.
