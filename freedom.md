# Freedom 

Freedom is the liberty or independence to do an action. Thus, freedom of expression with which we are concerned is the liberty to uninhibited expression of ones thoughts, ideas and emotions. Freedom of expression can only exist when the exercisor does not feel intimidated, stigmatized or otherwise negatively impacted by parties that do not share similar views, ideas or thoughts.
